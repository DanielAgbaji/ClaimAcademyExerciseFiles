Kiosk Change Calculator 
A retail store is building a kiosk to enter sales and handle transactions. When 
people use cash to pay for an item, the kiosk needs to tell the cashier how much 
change should be given back to the customer. 
You are developing a simple calculator
 that will compute the right amount and most 
efficient denominations of change for a specific purchase. 
returnChange(18, 17.18)
RESULT:    Quarters: 3 
  Dimes: 0 
  Nickels: 1 
  Pennies: 2
